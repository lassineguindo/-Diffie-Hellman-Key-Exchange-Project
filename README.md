# Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange-Project

## Project Overview
This project explores the **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**, a cryptographic method that allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure network. It is widely used in **VPNs, online banking, and secure communication protocols** like **TLS, IPsec, and SSH**.

## Presentation Topics
This project covered the following key areas:

### üîë **1. Introduction**
- Diffie-Hellman allows two parties to securely generate a **shared secret key** over a public channel.
- It uses **mathematical computations** to ensure security without exposing private keys.

### üîê **2. Why is it Important?**
- Enables **secure communication** over the internet.
- Prevents unauthorized access by ensuring **only intended recipients** can decrypt messages.

### ‚úÖ **3. Advantages of Diffie-Hellman**
- **Secure key exchange** over an **insecure channel**.
- **No prior key sharing required**‚Äîboth parties generate keys dynamically.
- **Foundation for other protocols** (TLS, IPsec, SSH).

### üåç **4. Real-World Scenarios**
- **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**  
  - Used to establish **secure remote access**.
  - Ensures **encrypted communication** between devices and networks.
- **Online Banking**  
  - Protects **financial transactions**.
  - Establishes **secure sessions** between the user‚Äôs browser and the bank‚Äôs server.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **5. Potential Threats**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks** ‚Äì Hackers intercept key exchanges and **impersonate users**.
- **Computational Attacks** ‚Äì Advanced mathematical attacks can break weak key exchanges.

### üîí **6. Mitigating Security Risks**
- **Authentication** ‚Äì Use authenticated versions of the protocol to prevent **MITM attacks**.
- **Strong Cryptographic Parameters** ‚Äì Ensure **large prime numbers** and secure key lengths to resist computational attacks.
